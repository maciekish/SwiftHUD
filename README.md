# SwiftHUD

SwiftHUD is a modern take on the classic HUD, written entirely in Swift and SwiftUI.

While there are other HUD's made in Swift, i created this one for two reasons.

1) Other libraries seem to have a slightly different focus and approach, i wanted a HUD that you could attach to any view, and not necessarily only over the entire screen. For example, using SwiftHUD you can display the HUD over a modal, while still retaining the functionality of the cancel button in the navigation bar if you want.

2) I didn't like the way the other HUDs looked, so i created my own. So now you have one more to choose from :)
